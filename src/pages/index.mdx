	Hello! I usually go by the moniker Kognise <span role='button' id='ipa'>/ˈkägˌnaɪz/</span> on the internet. Many things capture my interest, and this website features some of them. You may enjoy reading one of [the articles I've written](/writing).

	## Computers!

	I spend a significant portion of my time writing code and creating with technology. I believe in having passion for your craft and attention to detail. Since I just adore building things, I have a huge amount of side projects that I don't really know what to do with! You can [see an abridged list of stuff I've done](#projects) if you're interested.

	I use TypeScript, Rust, and Next.js on a daily basis and love them. I used to daily drive NixOS with KDE Plasma (you can [check out my dotfiles](https://github.com/kognise/dotfiles/), they're not half bad) but now just use macOS and reserve NixOS for my desktop at home. I design everything for myself and for others using Figma.

	I'm often asked, "hey Lexi, what kind of programming do you do?", and I never quite know how to answer. I do everything. Frontend! Backend! Embedded hardware! Mobile apps! Compilers! I find it immensely enjoyable to learn how shit works and go down rabbit holes, and I pick up whatever's needed to build what I'm excited about.

	In the summer of 2021 I rode across the country with a bunch of other cool programmers on a literal freaking [superdome train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Dome_(railcar)), and that was pretty cool. Recently, I've been traveling a lot to meet developer friends in person. This has even taken me to Kalamazoo, which I didn't previously realize was a real city in Michigan.

	9-year-old me making friends with a cool robot I made:

	<img src='/photos/robot.jpg' alt='A young girl holding hands with a robot made mostly out of cardboard and covered in tinfoil. The face of the robot has lit LEDs and some electronics can be seen inside. A desk with wires and a roll of tinfoil can be seen in the background.' width='1200' height='1148' loading='lazy' style='width: min(400px, 100%);' />

	## Airplanes!

	I think aviation is pretty cool. I soloed about a year ago and am planning on finishing my license soon!

	I'm currently learning to fly the good ol' [Cessna 172](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_172) for my Private Pilot License. I also enjoy playing flight simulators; I use Microsoft Flight Simulator in VR  as well as FlightGear, and occasionally pilot or control on VATSIM. I mentioned travelling earlier: when I have the chance, I love flying as a passenger.

	Here are some neat pictures I took from the air:

	<div class='grid-twos'>

The photograph is taken from the perspective of standing at the door, and is partially obscured by a brown ceiling held up by columns.' width='1400' height='788' loading='lazy' />

		<img src='/photos/plane-night.jpg' alt='San Antonio, Texas as seen from above at night. A wing strut can be seen in the foreground.' width='1400' height='788' loading='lazy' />

		<img src='/photos/plane-front.jpg' alt='A small Cessna plane sitting in a parking area, taken from the front. A beautiful blue sky with spread out fluffy clouds is on top.' width='1400' height='788' loading='lazy' />

		<img src='/photos/plane-cockpit.jpg' alt='The analog cockpit of a Cessna 172, with the plane rolling slightly to the left.' width='1400' height='788' loading='lazy' />
	</div>

	## Music!

	When I'm not programming, flying, or slacking off, I'm probably doing something music-related. I've been playing classical, jazz, and contemporary music on cello for almost 11 years. I compose music for acoustic instruments and create electronic bleep bloop sounds in a variety of styles using [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/), [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/), [Pd](https://puredata.info/), and [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max/). Perhaps I'll release an album eventually.

	The large portion of my time awake is spent listening to music. <span id='song'>In fact, I'm probably listening to some music right now!</span> My taste is very multifaceted, but I primarily listen to upbeat songs. I also [play Beat Saber badly](https://scoresaber.com/u/4470475412964296).

	Here are my favorite albums of all time, in no particular order:

	- [boneyard aka fearmonger by underscores](https://album.link/us/i/1591626228) (amazing rock-hyperpop-edm blend)
	- [Nurture by Porter Robinson](https://album.link/us/i/1550626757) (electronic bliss)
	- [i know there's something left for you by Dynastic](https://album.link/us/i/1606797651) (rock? hyperpop? either way, it's amazing)
	- [escape room by Rural Internet](https://album.link/us/i/1586742477) (hyperpop-inspired rap)
	- [More Songs About Buildings and Cows by The Meat Purveyors](https://album.link/us/i/5281169) (bluegrass)
	- [Spirit Phone by Lemon Demon](https://album.link/us/i/1088595729) (synthpop or something)
	- [A Fever You Can't Sweat Out by Panic! At The Disco](https://album.link/us/i/80456435) (pop punk)
	- [MIXPEED ACTION by Kobaryo](https://album.link/us/i/1387451656) (speedcore)

	## Other things!

	Recently I've been getting into rock climbing. While I suck, it's the first physical activity that I've actually taken pleasure in!

	I enjoy engulfing myself in books and watching movies. Many of my favorite films are anime-style, including almost everything by Studio Ghibli as well as CoMix Wave Films; my favorite Ghibli movie is probably [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087544/). Live-action movies that stuck out to me as really great are [Dr. Strangelove](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/), [Memento](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/), and [Lady Bird](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4925292/). I'm also a die-hard fan of the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy.

	Some of my favorite books that I can 100% recommend:
